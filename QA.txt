Logs for Application Load Balancer?
5 files for 5 APB or for one?
If 5 APB, are 5 APB have same or different configurations?
If 5 files for 5 APB, do they serve requests for 1 app or 5 different apps?
If 5 APB are differently configured, then I assume that for each configuration I will find different securirty vulnerabilities
